ðŸ§  Flash Loan Attack Vectors â€“ Advanced Crypto Exploit Module
What is a Flash Loan?
A flash loan is a type of uncollateralized loan offered by certain DeFi protocols (e.g., Aave, dYdX, Uniswap) that must be borrowed and repaid within the same blockchain transaction. If the borrower fails to repay, the entire transaction is reverted.

Why Are Flash Loans Dangerous?
Flash loans can be exploited due to their atomic nature and the composability of DeFi protocols. Attackers can manipulate multiple protocols in a single transaction to:

Exploit price oracles
Drain liquidity pools
Trigger liquidation cascades
Manipulate governance mechanisms
Common Flash Loan Attack Vectors
1. Oracle Manipulation
Target: Protocols relying on on-chain price feeds.
Method: Use flash loan to buy/sell large amounts of a token, skewing the price temporarily.
Impact: Triggers incorrect collateral valuations, enabling undercollateralized borrowing or liquidation.
2. Liquidity Pool Drain
Target: AMMs like Uniswap or Balancer.
Method: Use flash loan to swap tokens in a way that exploits pool imbalance or fee logic.
Impact: Drains pool reserves or extracts excessive fees.
3. Reentrancy Exploits
Target: Smart contracts with poor reentrancy protection.
Method: Use flash loan to call a vulnerable contract repeatedly before state updates.
Impact: Double-withdrawals, fund theft.
4. Governance Manipulation
Target: DAOs or protocols with token-based voting.
Method: Borrow governance tokens via flash loan, vote on malicious proposals.
Impact: Protocol takeover or fund redirection.
5. Liquidation Arbitrage
Target: Lending platforms like Compound or MakerDAO.
Method: Use flash loan to force liquidations by manipulating collateral prices.
Impact: Profitable arbitrage, systemic risk.
Real-World Examples
bZx Protocol (2020): Oracle manipulation led to $1M loss.
Alpha Homora + Cream Finance (2021): $37M drained via reentrancy and flash loan combo.
Yearn Finance Vault (2021): $11M loss due to complex multi-protocol exploit.
Mitigation Strategies
Use time-weighted average price (TWAP) or Chainlink oracles.
Implement reentrancy guards and rate limits.
Monitor transaction atomicity and flash loan usage patterns.
Apply circuit breakers for abnormal activity.
