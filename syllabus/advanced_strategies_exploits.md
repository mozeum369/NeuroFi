## Flash Loans and Arbitrage
Flash loans allow borrowing without collateral within a single transaction. Used for arbitrage, collateral swaps, and protocol exploits.

## MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)
MEV refers to profits miners/validators can extract by reordering transactions. Includes front-running, back-running, and sandwich attacks.

## Sandwich Attacks and Front-running
Sandwich attacks involve placing orders before and after a victim's transaction to manipulate price. Front-running exploits transaction visibility.
