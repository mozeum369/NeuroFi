# Self-Learning Systems

## Meta-learning and Strategy Evolution
Enable agents to adapt and evolve strategies based on performance feedback.

## Anomaly Detection in Time-Series
Detect unusual patterns in price, volume, and sentiment using ML.

## Feedback Loops and Reward Systems
Implement reinforcement learning with reward signals for useful discoveries.

## Autonomous Agent Architecture
Design agents that simulate human browsing, learning, and decision-making.
